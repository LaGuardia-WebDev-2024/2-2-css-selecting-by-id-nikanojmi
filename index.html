<h1>  Bassic Info: </h1>
  <p>
    Giraffs are the cutest biggest animal on this planet. These wild creatures started living in east africa 1 million years ago and now live in semi - arid savannah africa and other parts of the world with a dry climate. A giraff is special because of it's long kneck that can reach high tress for food. Giraffs eat mostly leaves and buds on trees and shrub.  Giraffs are the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant on Earth. They are special animals.
